# Just a Quick UI Tour
UI demo of the iOS health app Active Boomers - a simple but lovely iOS workout helper designed for seniors (or beginners!)
<br>
<br>

## 1. Home View
The purpose of the app is very simple and straight forward: helping seniors stay physically active. Let’s get started with the home view.
The home view provides two recommended activities for the day (along with date/weather info at the top) as well as a dashboard that tracks your weekly achievements.

## 2. Browse View
In addition to the recommendations provided to them in the home view, user can also go directly to the browse view to search for particular exercises that interest them.

Here’s a full list of resistance activities.  Clicking on the heart button at the top right corner of the screen, user will be able to filter the full list and see only their favourites.

## 3. Activity View
Once user has decided which activity to they want to do, they simply click on that button, and here comes this activity view.
Now, they can either add this activity to the calendar/reminder by clicking on the Add to Plan button and do it at a later time, or they can just do it straight away and track their weekly achievements.

For each activity, user will be given a suggested duration of the workout, but they also have the option to adjust it according to their needs.

<br>
After hitting the Done button, a quick survey pops out, asking for their feedback, which will further help the app improve its recommendation system (powered by the collaborative filtering algorithm).

## 4. Plan View
Remeber that user has the option to schedule a workout. Now, if you go to the below plan view, you will be able to see the activities that you have done and the ones you planning on doing. You can also edit/change those plans as needed.

## 5. Map View
When an activity is categorised as an outdoor one, there’s a map available for them to explore the area. They will be able to find out all the public open spaces (parks) as well as other essential facilities nearby (eg. hospitals, toilets, seats, water fountains, bike rails, etc.)
We have also implemented day/night mode, providing different feels on different time of the day.

Also, if you click on one of these icons, you will be able to see a popup for more info about that particular location/facility. And if you go ahead and click on the popup, you will be directed to [Apple Maps](https://www.apple.com/au/ios/maps/) and be able to use their navigation functions directly.

<br>

## 6. Event View
Finally, this lovely app also has an event wall featuring all the fun stuff going on in the area.
